        <p>So far, we've plotted and visualized data in various ways.  Today,
we'll see how to statistically back up some of the observations
we've made in looking at our data.  Statistics is a tool that helps
separate newsmaking data-backed stories from one-off anecdotes.
Usually, both kinds of stories start with a hunch, and statistics
helps us quantify the evidence backing that hunch.</p>
<p>Whenever you have a hunch (a <strong>hypothesis</strong> in statistician-speak),
the first thing to do is to look at some summary statistics (e.g.,
averages), and explore the data graphically as we did yesterday.  If
the visualizations seem to support your hunch, you will move into
hypothesis-testing mode.</p>
<h2>Two Running Examples</h2>

<p>For our first set of tests, we're going to use two running examples:
campaign spending and a fun comparison of two towns' citizens' heights.  Here are the two scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>One thing that's been claimed about the 2008 election is that
President Obama raised smaller quantities from a larger group of
donors than Senator McCain, who raised a smaller number of large
contributions.  Statistical techniques will help us determine how
true this statement is.</li>
<li>Imagine two towns that only differ in
that one of the towns had "something in the water" the year a bunch
of kids were born.  Did that something in the water affect the
height of these kids?  (Note: This situation is unrealistic.  It's
never the case that the only difference between two communities is
the one you want to measure, but it's a nice goal!)  We'll use statistics
to determine whether the two communities have meaninfully different heights.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Comparing Averages</h3>

<p>Let's start by comparing a simple statistic, to see if in the data
we observe there's any difference.  We'll start by comparing the
average heights of the two towns.  (As an aside: it would help if
you wrote and ran your code in <code>dataiap/day3/</code> today, since
several modules like <code>ols.py</code> are available in that directory).</p>

        <p>It looks like town 2's average height (6.35 feet) is higher than
town 1 (5.87 feet) by a difference of .479 feet.  This difference is
called the <strong> effect size </strong>.  Town 2 certainly looks taller than
Town 1!</p>

        <p><strong> Exercise </strong> Compute the average campaign contribution for the
Obama and McCain campaigns from the dataset in day 1.  What's the
effect size?  We have an average contribution of $423 for McCain and
$192 for Obama, for an effect size of $231.  McCain appears, on
average, to have more giving donors.</p>

        <p>Before we fire up the presses on either of these stories, let's look
at the data in more depth.</p>
<h3>Graph The Data</h3>

<p>If you finished yesterday's histogram exercise, then feel free to skip down to the <a href="http://dataiap.github.io/dataiap/day3/hypothesis_testing.html#boxplot">box plot section</a></p>
<p>The effect size in both of our examples seems large.  It would be
nice to more than just compare averages.  Let's try to look at a
histogram of the distributions.  We created a histogram of the two
campaigns contributions, binned by $100 increments.</p>

        <p>before displaying the plot in order to set the x-values of the
histogram to cut off donations larger than $20,000 or smaller than
-$20,000 (refunds).  With bar widths of 50 and increments of $100, your
histogram will look something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="A histogram comparing the McCain and Obama 2008 campaign contributions" src="./hypothesis_testing.py_files/mccain-obama-histogram.png"></p>
<p><a name="boxplot"></a></p>
<p>Ouch!  I can't make heads or tails of that.  It seems like Obama has
a larger number of small donations, but there isn't a lot of
granularity at that scale.  For large datasets, a histogram might
have too much information on it to be helpful.  Luckily, descriptive
statisticians have a more concise visualization.  It's called a
box-and-whisker plot!  The code for it is quite simple as well:</p>

        <p>Here's what we see:</p>
<p><img alt="Boxplots of the towns&#39; heights" src="./hypothesis_testing.py_files/town_boxplots.png"></p>
<p>Let's interpret this plot.  We show town 1 on the left and town 2 on
the right.  Each town is represented by a box with a red line and
whiskers.</p>
<ul>
<li>The red line in the box represents the <strong> median </strong>, or
<strong> 50th percentile </strong> value of the distribution.  If we sort the
dataset, 50% of the values will be below this line, and 50% will be
above it.</li>
<li>The bottom edge of the box represents the <strong> 25th percentile </strong>
(the value larger than 25% of your dataset), and the top edge
represents the <strong> 75th percentile </strong> (the value larger than 75% of
your dataset).  The difference between the 75th and 25th percentile
is called the <strong> inner quartile range (IQR) </strong>.</li>
<li>The whiskers represent the "extremes" of our dataset: the
  largest value we're willing to consider in our dataset before
  calling it an outlier.  In our case, we set <strong> whis=1 </strong>,
  requesting that we show whiskers the most extreme value at a
  distance of at most 1x the IQR from the bottom and top edges of
  the box plot.</li>
</ul>
<p>If normal distributions are your thing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Boxplot_vs_PDF.svg">this
image</a> might
help you interpret the box-and-whiskers plot.</p>
<p>Like in the histogram, we see that the towns' height distributions don't look all
that different from one-another.  Generally, if the boxes of each
distribution overlap, and you haven't taken something on the order
of a buttload (metric units) of measurements, you should doubt the
differenes in distribution averages.  It looks like a single height
measurement for town 1 is pretty far away from the others, and you
should investigate such measurements as potential outliers.</p>

        <p>we got the following plot</p>
<p><img alt="Boxplots of McCain and Obama 2008 campaign contributions" src="./hypothesis_testing.py_files/mccain-obama-boxplot.png"></p>
<p>Obama is on the left, and McCain on the right.  Real data sure
is more confusing than fake data!  Obama's box plot is a lot tighter
than McCains, who has a larger spread of donation sizes.  Both of
Obama's whiskers are visible on this chart, whereas only the top
whisker of McCain's plot is visible.  Another feature we haven't
seen before is the stream of blue dots after each of the whiskers on
each of Obama and McCain's plots.  These represent potential <strong>
outliers </strong>, or values that are extreme and do not represent the
majority of the dataset.</p>
<p>It was easy to say that the histograms and box plots for the town
heights overlapped heavily.  So while the effect size for town heights was pretty large, the distributions don't actually look all that different from one-another.</p>
<p>The campaign plots are a bit harder to discern.  The histogram told us virtually nothing.  The box plot showed us that Obama's donations seemed more concentrated on the smaller end, whereas McCains seemed to span a larger range.  There was overlap between the boxes in the plot, but we don't really have a sense for just how much overlap or similarity there is between these distributions.  In the next section, we'll quantify the difference using statistics!</p>
<h3>Run a Statistical Test</h3>

<p>We have two population height averages.  We know that they are
different, but charts show that overall the two towns look similar.
We have two campaign contribution averages that are also different,
but with a murkier story after looking at our box-and-whisker plots.
How will we definitively say whether the differences we observe are
meaningful?</p>
<p>In statistics, what we are asking is whether differences we observed
are reliable indicators of some trend, or just happened by lucky
chance. For example, we might simply have measured particularly
short members of town 1 and tall members of town 2.  <strong> Statistical
significance </strong> is a measure of the probability that, for whatever
reason, we stumbled upon the results we did by chance.</p>
<p>There are several tests for statistical significance, each applying
to a different question.  Our question is: "Is the difference
between the average height of people in town 1 and town 2
statistically significant?"  We ask a similar question about the
difference in average campaign contributions.  The test that
answers this question is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test">T-Test</a>.  There are
several flavors of T-Test and we will discuss these soon, but for
now we'll focus on Welch's T-Test.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The Welch's T-Test emitted a p-value of <strong> .349 </strong>.  A p-value is the
probability that the effect size of .479 feet between town 1 and town
2 happened by chance.  In this case, there's 34.9% chance that we've
arrived at our effect size by chance.</p>
<p>What's a good cutoff for p-values to know whether we should trust
the effect size we're seeing?  Two popular values are .05 or .01: if
there is less than a 5% or 1% chance that we arrived at our answer
by chance, we're willing to say that we have a <strong> statistically
significant </strong> result.</p>
<p>So in our case, our result is not significant.  Had we taken more
measurements, or if the differences in heights were farther apart,
we might have reached significance.  But, given our current results,
let's not jump to conclusions.  After all, it was just food coloring
in the water!</p>

        <p><strong> Exercise </strong> Run Welch's T-test on the campaign data.  Is the
effect size between McCain and Obama significant?  By our
measurements, the p-value reported is within rounding error of 0.
That's significant by anyone's measure: there's a near-nonexistant
chance we're seeing this difference between the candidates by some
random fluke in the universe.  Time to write an article!</p>

        <h3>Can You Have a Very Significant Result?</h3>

<p>No.  There is no such thing as "very" or "almost" significant.
Remember: the effect size is the interesting observation, and it's
up to you what makes for an impressive effect size depending on the
situation.  You can have small effects, large effects, and everything
in between.  Significance testing tells us whether to believe that
the observations we made happened by anything more than random
chance.  While people disagree about whether a p-value of .05 or .01
is required, they all agree that significance is a binary value.</p>

        <h3>Types of T-Test</h3>

<p>The T-Test has two major flavors: paired
and unpaired.</p>
<p>Sometimes your datasets are <strong> paired </strong> (also called <strong> dependent
</strong>). For example, you may be measuring the performance of the same
set of students on an exam before and after teaching them the course
content.  To use a paired T-Test, you have to be able to measure an
item twice, usually before and after some treatment.  This is the
ideal condition: by having before and after measurements of a
treatment, you control for other potential differences in the items
you mentioned, like performance between students.</p>
<p>Other times, you are measuring the difference between two sets of
measured data, but the individual measurements in each dataset are
<strong> unpaired </strong> (sometimes called <strong> independent </strong>).  This was the
case in our tests: different people contributed to each campaign,
and different people live in town 1 and 2.  With unpaired datasets,
we lose the ability to control for differences between individuals,
so we'll likely need more data to achieve statistical significance.</p>
<p>Unpaired datasets come in all flavors.  Depending on whether the
sizes of the sets are equal or unequal, and depending on whether the
variances of both sets are equal, you will run different versionf of
an unpaired T-Test.  In our case, we made no assumptions about the
sizes of our datasets, and no assumptions on their variances,
either.  So we went with an unpaired, unequal size, unequal variance
test.  That's Welch's T-Test.</p>
<p>As with all life decisions, if you want more details, check out the
Wikipedia article on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test">T-Tests</a>.  There
are implementations of <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_rel.html#scipy.stats.ttest_rel">paired
T-Tests</a>
and <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html#scipy.stats.ttest_ind">unpaired
ones</a>
in scipy.  The unequal variance case is not available in scipy,
which is why we included welchsttest.py.  Enjoy it!</p>
<h3>T-Test Assumptions we Broke:(</h3>

<p>We've managed to sound like smartypantses that do all the right
things until this moment, but now we have to admit we broke a few
rules.  The math behind T-Tests makes assumptions about the datasets
that makes it easier to achieve statistical significance if those
assumptions are true.  The big assumption is that the data we used
came from a normal distribution.</p>
<p>The first thing we should have done is check whether or not our data
is actually normal.  Luckily, the fine scipy folks have implemented
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro-Wilk">Shapiro-Wilk test</a>
test for normality.  This test calculates a p-value, that, if low
enough (usually &lt; 0.05), tells us there is a low chance the
distribution is normal.</p>

        <p><strong> Exercise </strong> Test the campaign contribution datasets for
normality.  We found them to not be normal (p = .003 for Obama and
.014 for McCain), which means we likely broke the normality
assumption of Welch's T-Test.  The statistics police are going to be
paying us a visit.</p>

        </div>
        <p>This turns out to be OK for two reasons: T-Tests are resilient to
breaking of the normality assumption, and, if you're really serious
about your statistics, there are <strong> nonparametric </strong> equivalents
that don't make normality assumptions.  They are more conservative
since they can't make assumptions about the data, and thus likely
require a larger sample size to reach significance.  If you're
alright with that, feel free to run the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U">Mann-Whitney
U</a>
nonparametric version of the T-Test, which has a wonderful name.</p>

        <p>Remember: we don't need to run the Mann-Whitney U test on our town
data, since it didn't exhibit non-normalcy.  And besides, the
p-value is .254.  That's still not significant.  This makes sense:
our less conservative Welch's test was unable to give us
significance, so we don't expect a more conservative test to
magically find significance.</p>

        <p><strong> Exercise </strong> since we shouldn't be using Welch's T-Test on the
campaign contribution data, run the Mann-Whitney U test on the data.
Is the difference between the Obama and McCain contributions still
significant?</p>

        <p>We got a p-value of about 0, so you will still find the result to be
statistically significant.  A+ for you!</p>

So far, we've learned the steps to test a hypothesis:<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Compute summary statistics, like averages or medians, and see if
 these numbers match your intuition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look at the distribution histograms or summary visualizations
  like box plots to understand whether your hypothesis appears to be
  backed up by the data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it's not immediately clear your hypothesis was wrong, test it
  using the appropriate statistical test to 1) quantify the effect
  size, and 2) ensure the data you observed couldn't have happened
  by chance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a lot more to statistics than T-Tests, which compare two
 datasets' averages.  Next, we'll cover correlation between two
 datasets using <a href="http://dataiap.github.io/dataiap/day3/regression.html">linear regression</a>.</p>
