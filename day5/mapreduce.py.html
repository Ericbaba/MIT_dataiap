        <p>On day 4, we saw how to process text data using the Enron email dataset.  In reality, we only processed a small fraction of the entire dataset: about 15 megabytes of Kenneth Lay's emails.  The entire dataset containing many Enron employees' mailboxes is 1.3 gigabytes, about 87 times than what we worked with.  And what if we worked on GMail, Yahoo! Mail, or Hotmail?  We'd have several petabytes worth of emails, at least 71 million times the size of the data we dealt with.</p>
<p>All that data would take a while to process, and it certainly couldn't fit on or be crunched by a single laptop.  We'd have to store the data on many machines, and we'd have to process it (tokenize it, calculate tf-idf) using multiple machines.  There are many ways to do this, but one of the more popular recent methods of <em>parallelizing data computation</em> is based on a programming framework called MapReduce, an idea that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce">Google presented to the world in 2004</a>.  Luckily, you do not have to work at Google to benefit from MapReduce: an open-source implementation called <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> is available for your use!</p>
<p>You might worry that we don't have hundreds of machines sitting around for us to use them.  Actually, we do!  <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> offers a service called Elastic MapReduce (EMR) that gives us access to as many machines as we would like for about <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/pricing/">10 cents per hour</a> of machine we use.  Use 100 machines for 2 hours?  Pay Amazon aroud $2.00.  If you've ever heard the buzzword <em>cloud computing</em>, this elastic service is part of the hype.</p>
<p>Let's start with a simple word count example, then rewrite it in MapReduce, then run MapReduce on 20 machines using Amazon's EMR, and finally write a big-person MapReduce workflow to calculate TF-IDF!</p>
<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>We're going to be using two files, <code>dataiap/day5/term_tools.py</code> and <code>dataiap/day5/package.tar.gz</code>.  Either write your code in the <code>dataiap/day5</code> directory, or copy these files to the directory where your work lives.</p>
<h3>Counting Words</h3>

<p>We're going to start with a simple example that should be familiar to you from day 4's lecture.  First, unzip the JSON-encoded Kenneth Lay email file:</p>
      </div><div class="code">
        <div class="highlight"><pre><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">unzip</span> <span class="n">dataiap</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">datasets</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">emails</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">kenneth_json</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">zip</span></pre></div></pre></div>
      </div><div class="docs">
        <div class="octowrap">
          <a class="octothorpe" href="http://dataiap.github.io/dataiap/day5/mapreduce#section-">#</a>
        </div>
        <p>This will result in a new file called <code>lay-k.json</code>, which is JSON-encoded.  What is JSON?  You can think of it like a text representation of python dictionaries and lists.  If you open up the file, you will see on each line something that looks like this:</p>
<p><code>{"sender": "rosalee.fleming@enron.com", "recipients": ["lizard_ar@yahoo.com"], "cc": [], "text": "Liz, I don't know how the address shows up when sent, but they tell us it's \nkenneth.lay@enron.com.\n\nTalk to you soon, I hope.\n\nRosie", "mid": "32285792.1075840285818.JavaMail.evans@thyme", "fpath": "enron_mail_20110402/maildir/lay-k/_sent/108.", "bcc": [], "to": ["lizard_ar@yahoo.com"], "replyto": null, "ctype": "text/plain; charset=us-ascii", "fname": "108.", "date": "2000-08-10 03:27:00-07:00", "folder": "_sent", "subject": "KLL's e-mail address"}</code></p>
<p>It's a dictionary representing an email found in Kenneth Lay's mailbox.  It contains the same content that we dealt with on day 4, but encoded into JSON, and rather than one file per email, we have a single file with one email per line.</p>
<p>Why did we do this?  Big data crunching systems like Hadoop don't deal well with lots of small files: they want to be able to send a large chunk of data to a machine and have to crunch on it for a while.  So we've processed the data to be in this format: one big file, a bunch of emails line-by-line.  If you're curious how we did this, check out <code>dataiap/day5/emails_to_json.py</code>.</p>
<p>Aside from that, processing the emails is pretty similar to what we did on day 4.  Let's look at a script that counts the words in the text of each email (Remember: it would help if you wrote and ran your code in <code>dataiap/day5/...</code> today, since several modules like <code>term_tools.py</code> are available in that directory).</p>

        <p>You can save this script to <code>exercise1.py</code> and then run <code>python exercise1.py dataiap/datasets/emails/lay-k.json</code>.  It will print the word count in due time.  <code>get_terms</code> is similar to the word tokenizer we saw on day 4.  <code>words</code> keeps track of the number of times we've seen each word.  <code>email = JSONValueProtocol.read(line)[1]</code> uses a JSON decoder to convert each line into a dictionary called email, that we can then tokenize into individual terms.</p>
<p>As we said before, running this process on several petabytes of data is infeasible because a single machine might not have petabytes of storage, and we would want to enlist multiple computers in the counting process to save time.</p>
<p>We need a way to tell the system how to divide the input data amongst
multiple machines, and then combine all of their work into a single
count per term.  That's where MapReduce comes in!</p>
<h3>Motivating MapReduce</h3>

<p>You may have noticed that the various programs we have written in previous exercises look somewhat repetitive.</p>
<p>Remember when we processed the campaign donations dataset to create a
histogram?  We basically:</p>
<ol>
<li>extracted the candidate name and donation amount <strong>from each</strong> line and
computed the histogram bucket for the amount</li>
<li><strong>grouped the</strong> donations by candidate name and donation amount.</li>
<li><strong>summarized</strong> each (candidate, donation) bucket by counting the number
of donations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now consider computing term frequency in the previous class. We:</p>
<ol>
<li>cleaned and extracted terms <strong>from each</strong> email file</li>
<li><strong>grouped</strong> the terms by which folder they were from</li>
<li><strong>summarized</strong> each folder's group by counting the number of times
each term was seen.</li>
</ol>
<p>This three-step pattern of 1) extracting and processing <strong>from each</strong>
line or file, 2) <strong>grouping by</strong> some attribute(s), and 3)
<strong>summarizing</strong> the contents of each group is common in data processing tasks.  We implemented step 2 by
adding elements to a global dictionary (e.g.,
<code>folder_tf[e['folder']].update</code> in <a href="http://dataiap.github.com/dataiap/day4/index.html#tf">day 4's
code</a>).  We implemented step 3 by counting or summing the values in
the dictionary.</p>
<p>Using a dictionary like this works because the dictionary fits in
memory.  However if we had processed a lot more data, the dictionary
may not fit into memory, and it'll take forever to run.  Then what do
we do?</p>
<p>The researchers at Google also noticed this problem, and developed a
framework called MapReduce to run these kinds
of patterns on huge amounts of data.  When you use this framework, you just need to write
functions to perform each of the three steps, and the framework takes
care of running the whole pattern on one machine or a thousand machines!  They use a
different terminology for the three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Map (from each)</li>
<li>Shuffle (grouping by)</li>
<li>Reduce (summarize)</li>
</ol>
<p>OK, now that you've seen the motivation behind the MapReduce
technique, let's actually try it out.</p>
<h3>MapReduce</h3>

<p>Say we have a JSON-encoded file with emails (3,000,000 emails on
3,000,000 lines), and we have 3 computers to compute the number of
times each word appears.</p>
<p>In the <em>map</em> phase (figure below), we are going to send each computer
1/3 of the lines.  Each computer will process their 1,000,000 lines by
reading each of the lines and tokenizing their words.
For example, the first machine may extract "enron, call,...", while
the second machine extracts "conference, call,...".</p>
<p><img src="./mapreduce.py_files/lab_map.png" width="500"></p>
<p>From the words, we will create (key, value) pairs (or (word, 1) pairs
in this example).  The <em>shuffle</em> phase will
assigned each key to one of the 3 computer, and all the values associated with
the same key are sent to the key's computer.  This is necessary because the whole
dictionary doesn't fit in the memory of a single computer!   Think of
this as creating the (key, value) pairs of a huge dictionary that
spans all of the 3,000,000 emails.  Because the whole dictionary
doesn't fit into a single machine, the keys are distributed across our
3 machines.  In this example, "enron" is assigned to computer 1, while
"call" and "conference" are assigned to computer 2, and "bankrupt" is
assigned to computer 3.</p>
<p><img src="./mapreduce.py_files/lab_shuffle.png" width="500"></p>
<p>Finally, once each machine has received the values of the keys it's
responsible for, the <em>reduce</em> phase will process each key's value.  It does this by
going through each key that is assigned to the machine and executing
a <code>reducer</code> function on the values associated with the key.  For example,
"enron" was associated with a list of three 1's, and the reducer step
simply adds them up.</p>
<p><img src="./mapreduce.py_files/lab_reduce.png" width="500"></p>
<p>MapReduce is more general-purpose than just serving to count words.
Some people have used it to do exotic things like <a href="http://musicmachinery.com/2011/09/04/how-to-process-a-million-songs-in-20-minutes/">process millions of
songs</a>,
but we want you to work through an entire end-to-end example.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here's the wordcount example, but written as a
MapReduce application:</p>

        </div>
        <p>Let's break this thing down.  You'll notice the term MRJob in a bunch
of places.  <a href="https://github.com/Yelp/mrjob">MRJob</a> is a python package
that makes writing MapReduce programs easy.  The developers at Yelp (they wrote the <code>mrjob</code> module)
wrote a convenience class called <code>MRJob</code> that you will extend.  When it's run, it automatically hooks into the MapReduce
framework, reads and parses the input files, and does a bunch of other
things for you.</p>
<p>What we do is create a class <code>MRWordCount</code> that extends <code>MRJob</code>, and
implement the <code>mapper</code> and <code>reducer</code> functions.  If the program is run from the
command line (the <code>if __name__ == '__main__':</code> part), it will execute
the MRWordCount MapRedce program.</p>
<p>Looking inside <code>MRWordCount</code>, we see <code>INPUT_PROTOCOL</code> being set to
<code>JSONValueProtocol</code>.  By default, map functions expect a line of text
as input, but we've encoded our emails as JSON, so we let MRJob know
that.  Similarly, we explain that our reduce tasks will emit
dictionaries by setting <code>OUTPUT_PROTOCOL</code> appropriately.</p>
<p>The <code>mapper</code> function handles the functionality described in the first
image of the last section.  It takes each email, tokenizes it into
terms, and <code>yield</code>s each term.  You can <code>yield</code> a key and a value
(<code>term</code> and <code>1</code>) in a mapper (notice "yield" arrows in the second
figure above).  We yield the term with the value <code>1</code>,
meaning one instance of the word <code>term</code> was found.  <code>yield</code> is a
python keyword that turns functions into iterators (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/231767/the-python-yield-keyword-explained">stack
overflow explanation</a>).  In the context of writing <code>mapper</code> and
<code>reducer</code> functions, you can think of it as <code>return</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>reducer</code> function implements the third image of the last section.
We are given a word (the key emitted from mappers), and a list
<code>occurrences</code> of all of the values emitted for each instance of
<code>term</code>.  Since we are counting occurrences of words, we <code>yield</code> a
dictionary containing the term and a sum of the occurrences we've seen.</p>
<p>Note that we <code>sum</code> instead of <code>len</code> the <code>occurrences</code>.  This allows us to change the mapper implementation to emit the number of times each word occurs in a document, rather than <code>1</code> for each word.</p>
<p>Both the <code>mapper</code> and <code>reducer</code> offer us the parallelism we wanted.  There is no loop through our entire set of emails, so MapReduce is free to distribute the emails to multiple machines, each of which will run <code>mapper</code> on an email-by-email basis.  We don't have a single dictionary with the count of every word, but instead have a <code>reduce</code> function that has to sum up the occurrences of a single word, meaning we can again distribute the work to several reducing machines.</p>
<h3>Run It!</h3>

<p>Enough talk!  Let's run this thing.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The <code>-o</code> flag tells MRJob to output all reducer output to the <code>wordcount_test</code> directory.  The <code>--no-output</code> flag says not to print the output of the reducers to the screen.  The last argument (<code>'../datasets/emails/lay-k.json'</code>) specifies which file (or files) to read into the mappers as input.</p>
<p>Take a look at the newly created <code>wordcount_test</code> directory.  There should be at least one file (<code>part-00000</code>), and perhaps more.  There is one file per reducer that counted words.  Reducers don't talk to one-another as they do their work, and so we end up with multiple output files.  While the count of a specific word will only appear in one file, we have no idea which reducer file will contain a given word.</p>
<p>The output files (open one up in a text editor) list each word as a dictionary on a single line (<code>OUTPUT_PROTOCOL = JSONValueProtocol</code> in <code>mr_wordcount.py</code> is what caused this).</p>
<p>You will notice we have not yet run tasks on large datasets (we're still using <code>lay-k.json</code>) and we are still running them locally on our computers.  We will soon learn to movet his work to Amazon's cloud infrastructure, but running MRJob tasks locally to test them on a small file is forever important.  MapReduce tasks will take a long time to run and hold up several tens to several hundreds of machines.  They also cost money to run, whether they contain a bug or not.  Test them locally like we just did to make sure you don't have bugs before going to the full dataset.</p>

        <p><strong> Exercise </strong>  Create a second version of the MapReduce wordcounter that counts the number of each word emitted by each sender.  You will need this for later, since we're going to be calculating TF-IDF implementing  terms per sender.  You can accomplish this with a sneaky change to the <code>term</code> emitted by the <code>mapper</code>.  You can either turn that term into a dictionary, or into a more complicated string, but either way you will have to encode both sender and term information in that <code>term</code>.

        <p><strong> (Optional) Exercise </strong> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep"><code>grep</code> command</a> on UNIX-like systems allows you to search text files for some term or terms.  Typing <code>grep hotdogs file1</code> will return all instances of the word <code>hotdogs</code> in the file <code>file1</code>.  Implement a <code>grep</code> for emails.  When a user uses your mapreduce program to find a word in the email collection, they will be given a list of the subjects and senders of all emails that contain the word.  You might find you do not need a particularly smart reducer in this case: that's fine.  If you're pressed for time, you can skip this exercise.</p>

        <p>We now know how to write some pretty gnarly MapReduce programs, but they all run on our laptops.  Sort of boring.  It's time to move to the world of distributed computing, Amazon-style!</p>
<h3>Amazon Web Services</h3>

<p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS) is Amazon's gift to people who don't own datacenters.  It allows you to elastically request computation and storage resources at varied scales using different services.  As a testiment to the flexibility of the services, companies like NetFlix are moving their entire operation into AWS.</p>
<p>In order to work with AWS, you will need to set up an account.  If you're in the class, we will have given you a username, password, access key, and access secret.

        <p>Replace <code>your_key_id</code> and <code>your_access_id</code> with the ones you were assigned.</p>
<p>That's it!  There are more than a day's worth of AWS services to discuss, so let's stick with two of them: Simple Storage Service (S3) and Elastic MapReduce (EMR).</p>
<h3>AWS S3</h3>

<p>S3 allows you to store gigabytes, terabytes, and, if you'd like, petabytes of data in Amazon's datacenters.  This is useful, because laptops often don't crunch and store more than a few hundred gigabytes worth of data, and storing it in the datacenter allows you to securely have access to the data in case of hardware failures.  It's also nice because Amazon tries harder than you to have the data be always accessible.</p>
<p>In exchange for nice guarantees about scale and accessibility of data, Amazon charges you rent on the order of 14 cents per gigabyte stored per month.</p>
<p>Services that work on AWS, like EMR, read data from and store data to S3.  When we run our MapReduce programs on EMR, we're going to read the email data from S3, and write word count data to S3.</p>
<p>S3 data is stored in <strong> buckets </strong>.  Within a bucket you create, you can store as many files or folders as you'd like.  The name of your bucket has to be unique across all of the people that store their stuff in S3.  Want to make your own bucket?  Let's do this!</p>
<ul>
<li>Log in to the AWS console (the website), and click on the <strong> S3 </strong> tab.  This will show you a file explorer-like interface, with buckets listed on the left and files per bucket listed on the right.</li>
<li>Click "Create Bucket" near the top left.</li>
<li>Enter a bucket name.  This has to be unique across all users of S3.  Pick something like <code>dataiap-YOURUSERNAME-testbucket</code>.  <strong> Do not use underscores in the name of the bucket </strong>.</li>
<li>Click "Create"</li>
</ul>
<p>This gives you a bucket, but the bucket has nothing in it!  Poor bucket.  Let's upload Kenneth Lay's emails.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the bucket from the list on the left.</li>
<li>Click "Upload."</li>
<li>Click "Add Files."</li>
<li>Select the <code>lay-k.json</code> file on your computer.</li>
<li>Click "Start Upload."</li>
<li>Right click on the uploaded file, and click "Make Public."</li>
<li>Verify the file is public by going to <code>http://dataiap-YOURUSERNAME-testbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/lay-k.json</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Awesome!  We just uploaded our first file to S3.  Amazon is now hosting the file.  We can access it over the web, which means we can share it with other researchers or process it in Elastic MapReduce.  To save time, we've uploaded the entire enron dataset to <a href="https://dataiap-enron-json.s3.amazonaws.com/">https://dataiap-enron-json.s3.amazonaws.com/</a>.  Head over there to see all of the different Enron employee's files listed (the first three should be <code>allen-p.json</code>, <code>arnold-j.json</code>, and <code>arora-h.json</code>).</p>
<p>Two notes from here.  First, uploading the file to S3 was just an exercise---we'll use the <code>dataiap-enron-json</code> bucket for our future exercises.  That's because the total file upload is around 1.3 gigs, and we didn't want to put everyone through the pain of uploading it themselves.  Second, most programmers don't use the web interface to upload their files.  They instead opt to upload the files from the command line.  If you have some free time, feel free to check out <code>dataiap/resources/s3_util.py</code> for a script that copies directories to and downloads buckets from S3.</p>
<p>Let's crunch through these files!</p>
<h3>AWS EMR</h3>

<p>We're about to process the entire enron dataset.  Let's do a quick sanity check that our mapreduce wordcount script still works.  We're about to get into the territory of spending money on the order of 10 cents per machine-hour, so we want to make sure we don't run into preventable problems that waste money.</p>
      </div><div class="code">

        </div>
        <p>Did that finish running and output the word counts to <code>wordcount_test2</code>?  If so, let's run it on 20 machines (costing us $2, rounded to the nearest hour).  Before running the script, we'll talk about the parameters:</p>
      </div><div class="code">

      </div><div class="docs">
        <div class="octowrap">
          <a class="octothorpe" href="http://dataiap.github.io/dataiap/day5/mapreduce#section-">#</a>
        </div>
        <p>The parameters are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>num-ec2-instances</code>: we want to run on 20 machines in the cloud.  Snap!</li>
<li><code>python-archive</code>: when the script runs on remote machines, it will need term_tools.py in order to tokenize the email text.  We have packaged this file into package.tar.gz.</li>
<li><code>-r emr</code>: don't run the script locally---run it on AWS EMR.</li>
<li><code>-o  's3://dataiap-YOURUSERNAME-testbucket/output'</code>: write script output to the bucket you made when playing around with S3.  Put all files in a directory called <code>output</code> in that bucket.  Make sure you change <code>dataiap-YOURUSERNAME-testbucket</code> to whatever bucket name you picked on S3.</li>
<li><code>--no-output</code>: don't print the reducer output to the screen.</li>
<li><code>'s3://dataiap-enron-json/*.json'</code>: perform the mapreduce with input from the <code>dataiap-enron-json</code> bucket that the instructors created, and use as input any file that ends in <code>.json</code>.  You could have named a specific file, like <code>lay-k.json</code> here, but the point is that we can run on much larger datasets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check back on the script.  Is it still running?  It should be.  You may as well keep reading, since you'll be here a while.  In total, our run took three minutes for Amazon to requisition the machines, four minutes to install the necessary software on them, and between 15 adn 25 minutes to run the actual MapReduce tasks on Hadoop.  That might strike some of you as weird, and we'll talk about it now.</p>
<p>Understanding MapReduce is about understanding <strong> scale </strong>.  We're used to thinking of our programs as being about <strong> performance </strong>, but that's not the role of MapReduce.  Running a script on a single file on a single machine will be faster than running a script on multiple files split amongst multiple machines that shuffle data around to one-another and emit the data to a service (like EMR and S3) over the internet is not going to be fast.  We write MapReduce programs because they let us easily ask for 10 times more machines when the data we're processing grows by a factor of 10, not so that we can achieve sub-second processing times on large datasets.  It's a mental model switch that will take a while to appreciate, so let it brew in your mind for a bit.</p>
<p>What it does mean is that MapReduce as a programming model is not a magic bullet.  The Enron dataset is not actually so large that it shouldn't be processed on your laptop.  We used the dataset because it was large enough to give you an appreciation for order-of-magnitue file size differences, but not large enough that a modern laptop can't process the data.  In practice, don't look into MapReduce until you have several tens or hundreds of gigabytes of data to analyze.  In the world that exists inside most companies, this size dataset is easy to stumble upon.  So don't be disheartened if you don't need the MapReduce skills just yet: you will likely need them one day.</p>
<h3>Analyzing the output</h3>

<p>Hopefully your first mapreduce is done by now.  There are two bits of output we should check out.  First, when the MapReduce job finishes, you will see something like the following message in your terminal window:</p>

        <p>That's a summary of, on your 20 machines, how many Mappers and Reducers ran.  You can run more than one of each on a physical machine, which explains why more than 20 of each ran in our tasks.  Notice how many reducers ran your task.  Each reducer is going to receive a set of words and their number of occurrences, and emit word counts.  Reducers don't talk to one-another, so they end up writing their own files.</p>
<p>With this in mind, go to the S3 console, and look at the <code>output</code> directory of the S3 bucket to which you output your words.  Notice that there are several files in the <code>output</code> directory named <code>part-00000</code>, <code>part-00001</code>.  There should be as many files as there were reducers, since each wrote the file out.  Download some of these files and open them up.  You will see the various word counts for words across the entire Enron email corpus.  Life is good!</p>

        <h3>TF-IDF</h3>

<p>This section is going to further exercise our MapReduce-fu.</p>
<p>On <a href="http://dataiap.github.io/dataiap/day4/index.html">day 4</a>, we learned that counting words is not enough to summarize text: common words like <code>the</code> and <code>and</code> are too popular.  In order to discount those words, we multiplied by the term frequency of <code>wordX</code> by <code>log(total # documents/# documents with wordX)</code>.  Let's do that with MapReduce!</p>
<p>We're going to emit a per-sender TF-IDF.  To do this, we need three MapReduce tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first will calculate the number of documents, for the numerator in IDF.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second will calculate the number of documents each term appears in, for the denominator of IDF, and emits the IDF (<code>log(total # documents/# documents with wordX)</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third calculates a per-sender IDF for each term after taking both the second MapReduce's term IDF and the email corpus as input.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> HINT </strong> Do not run these MapReduce tasks on Amazon.  You saw how slow it was to run, so make sure the entire TF-IDF workflow works on your local machine with <code>lay-k.json</code> before moving to Amazon.</p>
<h3>MapReduce 1: Total Number of Documents</h3>

<p>Eugene and I are the laziest of instructors.  We don't like doing work where we don't have to.  If you'd like a mental exercise as to how to write this MapReduce, you can do so yourself, but it's simpler than the wordcount example.  Our dataset is small enough that we can just use the <code>wc</code> UNIX command to count the number of lines in our corpus:</p>
      </div><div class="code">
        <div class="highlight"><pre><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">wc</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">l</span> <span class="n">lay</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">json</span></pre></div></pre></div>

        </div>
        <p>Kenneth Lay has 5929 emails in his dataset.  We ran wc -l on the entire Enron email dataset, and got 516893.  This took a few seconds.  Sometimes, it's not worth overengineering a simple task!:)</p>
<p><a name="tfidfstep2"></a></p><h3><a name="tfidfstep2">MapReduce 2: Per-Term IDF</a></h3>
We recommend you stick to 516893 as your total number of documents, since eventually we're going to be crunching the entire dataset!<p></p>
<p>What we want to do here is emit <code>log(516893.0 / # documents with wordX)</code> for each <code>wordX</code> in our dataset.  Notice the decimal on 516893<strong>.0</strong>: that's so we do <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=947270">floating point division</a> rather than integer division.  The output should be a file where each line contains <code>{'term': 'wordX', 'idf': 35.92}</code> for actual values of <code>wordX</code> and <code>35.92</code>.</p>
<p>We've put our answer in <code>dataiap/day5/mr_per_term_idf.py</code>, but try your hand at writing it yourself before you look at ours.  It can be implemented with a three-line change to the original wordcount MapReduce we wrote (<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/math.html#math.log">one line just includes <code>math.log</code>!</a>).</p>
<h3>MapReduce 3: Per-Sender TF-IDFs</h3>

<p>The third MapReduce multiplies per-sender term frequencies by per-term IDFs.  This means it needs to take as input the IDFs calculated in the last step <strong> and </strong> calculate the per-sender TFs.  That requires something we haven't seen yet: initialization logic.  Let's show you the code, then tell you how it's done.</p>

        <p>If you did the <a href="http://dataiap.github.io/dataiap/day5/mapreduce#firstexercise">first exercise </a>, the <code>mapper</code> and <code>reducer</code> functions should look a lot like the per-sender word count <code>mapper</code> and <code>reducer</code> functions you wrote for that.  The only difference is that <code>reducer</code> takes the term frequencies and multiplies them by <code>self.idfs[term]</code>, to normalize by each word's IDF.  The other difference is the addition of <code>reducer_init</code>, which we will describe next.</p>
<p><code>self.idfs</code> is a dictionary containing term-IDF mappings from the <a href="http://dataiap.github.io/dataiap/day5/mapreduce#tfidfstep2">second MapReduce</a>.  Say you ran the IDF-calculating MapReduce like so:</p>

        </div>
        <p>The individual terms and IDFs would be emitted to the directory <code>idf_parts/</code>.  We would want to load all of these term-idf mappings into <code>self.idfs</code>.  Set <code>DIRECTORY</code> to the filesystem path that points to the <code>idf_parts/</code> directory.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we want to load some data before running the mapper or the reducer.  In our example, we want to load the IDF values into memory before executing the reducer, so that the values are available when we compute the tf-idf.  The function <code>reducer_init</code> is designed to perform this setup.  It is called before the first <code>reducer</code> is called to calculate TF-IDF.  It opens all of the output files in <code>DIRECTORY</code>, and reads them into <code>self.idfs</code>.  This way, when <code>reducer</code> is called on a term, the idf for that term has already been calculated.</p>
<p>To verify you've done this correctly, compare your output to ours.  There were some pottymouths that emailed Kenneth Lay:</p>
<p>{"tfidf": 13.155591168821202, "term_sender": {"term": "a-hole", "sender":       "justinsitzman@hotmail.com"}}</p>
<h3>Why is it OK to Load IDFs Into Memory?</h3>

<p>You might be alarmed at the moment.  Here we are, working with BIG DATA, and now we're expecting the TF-IDF calculation to load the entirety of the IDF data into memory on EVERY SINGLE reducer.  That's crazytown.</p>
<p>It's actually not.  While the corpus we're analyzing is large, the number of words in the English language (roughly the amount of terms we calculate IDF for) is not.  In fact, the output of the per-term IDF calculation was around 8 megabytes, which is far smaller than the 1.3 gigabytes we processed.  Keep this in mind: even if calculating something over a large amount of data is hard and takes a while, the result might end up small.</p>
<h3>Optional: Run The TF-IDF Workflow</h3>

<p>We recommend running the TF-IDF workflow on Amazon once class is over.  The first MapReduce script (per-term IDF) should run just fine on Amazon.  The second will not.  The <code>reducer_init</code> logic expects a file to live on your local directory.  You will have to modify it to read the output of the IDF calculations from S3 using <code>boto</code>.  Take a look at the code to implement <code>get</code> in <code>dataiap/resources/s3_util.py</code> for a programmatic view of accessing files in S3.</p>

We hope that MapReduce serves you well with large datasets.  If this kind of work excites you, here are some things to read up on.<p></p>
<ul>
<li>As you can see, writing more complex workflows for things like TF-IDF can get annoying.  In practice, folks use higher-level languages than <code>map</code> and <code>reduce</code> to build MapReduce workflows.  Some examples are <a href="http://pig.apache.org/">Pig</a>, <a href="http://hive.apache.org/">Hive</a>, and <a href="http://www.cascading.org/">Cascading</a>.</li>
<li>If you care about making your MapReduce tasks run faster, there are lots of tricks you can play.  One of the easiest things to do is to add a <a href="http://packages.python.org/mrjob/job.html#mrjob.job.MRJob.combiner">combiners</a> between your <code>mapper</code> and <code>reducer</code>.  A combiner has similar logic to a reducer, but runs on a mapper before the shuffle stage.  This allows you to, for example, pre-sum the words emitted by the map stage in a wordcount so that you don't have to shuffle as many words around.</li>
<li>MapReduce is one model for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing">parallel programming</a> called <strong> data parallelism </strong>.  Feel free to read about others.</li>
<li>When MapReduce runs on multiple computers, it's an example of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing">distributed computing</a>, which has a lot of interesting applications and problems to be solved.</li>
<li>S3 is a distributed storage system and is one of many.  It is built upon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_(storage_system)">Amazon's Dynamo</a> technology.  It's one of many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_file_system">distributed file systems</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_data_store">distributed data stores</a>.</li>
